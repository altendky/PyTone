PyTone

   MP3 Jukebox redux
   _________________________________________________________________

Summary

   PyTone is a music jukebox written in Python with a curses based GUI.
   While providing advanced features like crossfading and multiple
   players, special emphasis is put on ease of use, turning PyTone into
   an ideal jukebox system for use at parties.

Features

     * concise curses based GUI
     * simple song selection
          + using an arbitrary number of music databases with hierarchical 
            (artist/album/songs, genre/artist/album/songs, decades/artist/albums/songs,
            or rating/artist/albums/songs) navigation,
          + from list of top and last played songs,
          + from list of most recently added songs,
          + random song list,
          + stored playlists, or
          + alternatively from file system
     * editable playlist:

          + repetition and automatic addition of random songs, when the 
            playlist is empty
          + save to and load from .m3u file
     * pluggable players, currently
          + internal MP3/Ogg Vorbis player with crossfading and/or
          + xmms based external player and/or
          + mpg321 or (the non-free) mpg123 based external player
     * display of information for currently selected song:
          + ID3 tag
          + length
          + times played
          + last played
          + song rating (1 to 5 stars)
     * plays currently selected song on second player (if your computer
       has a second sound card or one card with more than one line out)
     * search functionality:
          + quick search by first letter
          + incremental search by regular expression
     * random song selection taking into account song rating and time at
       which song was last played
     * description of important key bindings in status bar and context 
       sensitive help

          + Python OSS module (included in Python 2.3 or available from [9] here)

Download

   The latest version of PyTone can be downloaded as gzipped tar archive
   from [10]here.

Installation

   If you want to use the internal libmad based player, you have to build
   one C extension module located in the pcm subdirectory. This
   can be done simply via

     $ python setup.py build_ext -i

   To enable support for transparent terminals set buildcursext = 1 at the top
   of the setup.py file before running the above command.

Configuration

   All configuration options of PyTone can be found in the sample configuration
   file conf/pytonerc. Side-wide configuration goes into /etc/pytonerc, user
   specific changes can be put into ~/.pytone/pytonerc. Note that you only have
   to supply options you want to change. Note that you only have to supply
   options you want to change. Furthermore, while most of the standard settings
   will probably fit your needs, you have to change the variable musicbasedir
   in the section [database.main] of the main database, which specifies the
   root of your primary MP3 collection. A minimal version of your configuration
   file should thus contain

     # minimal ~/.pytone/pytonerc defining the root of your music collection
     [database.main]
     musicbasedir=/root/of/your/music/collection


Usage

   After having adjusted the basic configuration variables to your personal
   needs, just start the program with

     $ ./pytone

   and look how the database is being rebuilt. The key bindings described
   below should say all about the use of PyTone. A list of command line
   options can be obtained by

     $ ./pytone --help

   Then let it rock...

   The remote control of PyTone is possible using the  pytonectl script.
   For a list of available options use:

     $ ./pytonectl --help

   In order for the remote control to work, either the socketfile
   or the enableserver option have to be set in the [network] section
   of the pytonerc file. By default, the former is the case.

History

   PyTone was written since my favourite MP3 Jukebox (KJukebox) wasn't
   maintained anymore. Its simple user interface and good usability even
   without a mouse combined with the crossfading ability of the player,
   have not been reached by any other free program. Especially for the
   use at a party, KJukebox was very well suited.

   However, after looking around on the net for sometime, I found [11]mjs,
   a curses based MP3 Jukebox system, which featured a really simple and
   efficient GUI. Unfortunately, it was written in C and already the
   first attempts to tailor it to my needs showed that probably a Python
   version of this program would be a great win. That's how the
   development of PyTone started...

   After one week of intensive programming version 1.0 of what was then
   called pyjuke was ready and was deployed during a three day long
   party. It proved to be very usable (even on a 38400 baud serial
   terminal) and astoundingly stable, even under extreme, Woodstock like
   conditions (very heavy rain + deep mud :-) )

   Subsequently, the internal mad based player was written, which
   provides crossfading capabilities without using xmms, a new, more
   imaginative name was found (kudos to Harry!) and PyTone was released.
