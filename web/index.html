<dt>2007/08/14</dt>

<dd>Version 3.0.1 released, which fixes tag filtering and adds virtual
directories for all songs which have at least been played once and for focusing
on all songs matching approximately (either in title, album or artist name) a
given search string. The lyrics display has been enabled now.</dd>

<dt>2007/08/01</dt>

<dd>Version 3.0.0 released, celebrating the national holiday of Switzerland, my
adopted country. This major release features a complete rewrite of the database
code, which is now based on SQLite, for improved speed and functionality. A
much more comprehensive subset of song metadata is now stored including song
lyrics, ReplayGain information, skip count, parts of a compilation, disk
number, songs bpm, sample- and bitrate. The tagging of songs and the
corresponding filtering has been introduced.

<br><b>Upgrade notes:</b>

The following config file options have been removed:
playlistdir (in the general section), and playlistload (in the keybindings.general section),
dbenvdir, basename and the tags_* options (in the database sections). New options
are postprocessors (in the database sections), which replaces the tags_* options by allowing
to specify a whitespace-separated list of metadata postprocessors, and toggledelete (in the
keybindings.filelistwindow) section.

<br>
Note that due to lack of resources on my side, there is and will be <b>no
converter from the old database format</b>. 

<br> Please be aware of the status as 0.0 version - there will almost certainly
be a couple of loose ends and bugs - and report any bugs you find!</dd>

<dt>2006/08/12</dt>

<dd>Version 2.3.1 released. This release contains various bug fixes, in
particular for a race condition which sometimes prevented PyTone from
starting.</dd>

<dt>2005/09/13</dt>

<dd>Version 2.3.0 released. Statistical information about the
databases can now be displayed. Nested database queries are now
supported. The size of the database request cache can be customized. A
C version of the output ring buffer has been added. The play speed can
now be changed (thanks to Richard A. Smith for providing the
patch). Various bugs have been fixed.</dd>


<dt>2005/06/20</dt>

<dd>Version 2.2.4 released. With this release the network
functionality has been restored (note that doing so, I've cleaned up
the network configuration options a bit, so you may need to update
your config files). An AudioScrobbler plugin provided by Nicolas
Évrard and plugins for displaying the currently playing song in the
X11 terminal title bar and using the xosd program (contributed by Dag
Wieers) are now contained in the distribution. It is now possible to
display not only the currently selected song in the item info window
but alternatively the song currently being played on the
players. Various bugs have been fixed.</dd>

<dt>2005/05/09</dt>

<dd>Thanks to Dag Wieers, there are now <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/packages/pytone/"> 
Red Hat/Fedora RPM packages for PyTone and its dependencies</a>.</dd>

<dd>Version 2.2.3 released containing bug fixes only.</dd>


<dt>2005/03/16</dt>

<dd>Version 2.2.2 released, which adds support for seeking in the song
(thanks to Tomas Menzl for providing a patch). The complete contents
of the playlist are now being kept after a restart of PyTone. When for
a given artist only songs from a single album are registered, PyTone can
now optionally skip the album selection directory. Directly jumping to
the album of the currently selected song in the playlist window has
been implemented. Changes to the database are now better reflected in
the database view. Database checkpointing works again.  A couple of
other bugs have been fixed.</dd>


<dt>2005/02/07</dt>

<dd>Version 2.2.1 released, which fixes a regression in the metadata
scanning code. More debugging output has been added. Services are now

database configuration options have been added. A problem with the
caching layer has been fixed.</dd>

<dt>2005/02/01</dt>

<dd>Version 2.2.0 released, which adds support for more than two
databases and a virtual database, which contains the songs from all
databases. A database caching layer was added for improved
performance. Thanks to a prototype by Nicolas Évrard, PyTone's
functionality can now be extended by plugins. A coupled of minor
bugs have been fixed.  </dd>

<dt>2004/11/29</dt>

<dd>Version 2.1.3 released, which fixes a couple of bugs in the
playlist and database code. Support for the latest pyxmms module and a
French translation of the UI (many thanks to Nicolas Évrard) have been
added. </dd>

<dt>2004/11/08</dt>

<dd>Version 2.1.0 released. This release contains mostly user
requests: Filtering songs by their rating is now possible. One of the
most often requested features, namely going back one song in the play
list finally has been implemented. Various configuration options now
allow the user to customise id3 tag transformations. The step size
used when changing the volume can be configure now. Incremental
searching and repetition of the last search have been implemented. A
song is now considered as not having been played if its playback has
been aborted very early (currently during the first 10 seconds). An
arbitrary shell command can be automatically executed when the
playback of a new song starts. The scheduled starting time of a song
can be displayed in the playlist. A coupled of bugs have been
fixed.</dd>

<dt>2004/07/22</dt>

<dd>Version 2.0.14 released, which contains numerous bug fixes. A
polish translation of the UI is now included (many thanks to Krzysztof
Zych).  Support for the eyeD3 id3 parsing module has been added. The
database code now makes use of the transactional capabilities provided
by the Sleepycat bsddb.  Searching by regular expression is now
possible.</dd>

message log window to PyTone and allows the user to specify the size
of the audio buffer used by the ALSA driver. Some files which
erroneously have been missing in the last distribution are now
included. When stopping the player, the currently playing song is
marked as unplayed again.</dd>

<dt>2004/03/17</dt>

<dd>The PyTone users mailing list moved to the LUGA server. See this
<a href="https://www.luga.de/mailman/listinfo/pytone-users/">page</a>

<dt>2004/02/15</dt>

<dd>Version 2.0.9 released, which adds support for transparent
terminals, allows the user to turn of the cross fading of songs and
improves the usability when using Braille displays. An endian issue on
the PowerPC platform and the reencoding of unicode strings in Ogg
Vorbis tags were fixed. PyTone is now more verbose when encountering errors during
startup. When updating the song database, songs which are no longer
accessible are deleted automatically.</dd>


<dt>2004/01/18</dt>

<h2><a name="download"></a>Download</h2>

<p>The latest released version of PyTone can be downloaded as gzipped tar archive from
<a href="download/PyTone-3.0.0.tar.gz">here</a>. The previous versions can still
be found <a href="download/">here</a>.

<h2><a name="development"></a>Development</h2>

<p> The latest development version of PyTone can be found in the <a
href="https://www.luga.de/svn/PyTone/">Subversion repository</a>. Patches are
prefered to be against the latest SVN version. </p>

<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>

<p>If you want to use the internal libmad based player, you have to build one C
extension module located in the <tt>pcm</tt> subdirectory. This can be
done simply via</p>

<pre>
$ python setup.py build_ext -i
</pre>

<p>Note that by default this builds also a C extension module for the output
ring-buffer, which requires the libao header files (see above). If you are
happy with the Python version of the output buffer, you can disable building
the C module by setting <tt>buildbufferedaoext = False</tt> at the top of the
<tt>setup.py</tt> file before running the above command.</p>

<p>To enable support for transparent terminals (only needed for Python 2.3.x)
set <tt>buildcursext = True</tt> at the top of the <tt>setup.py</tt> file
before running the above command.</p>

<h2><a name="configuration"></a>Configuration</h2>

<p>All configuration options of PyTone can be found in the sample
   configuration file <tt>conf/pytonerc</tt>. Side-wide configuration
   goes into /etc/pytonerc, user specific changes can be put into
   <tt>~/.pytone/pytonerc</tt>.  Note that you only have to supply
   options you want to change. Furthermore, while most of the standard
   settings will probably fit your needs, you have to
   change the variable <tt>musicbasedir</tt> in the section
   <tt>[database.main]</tt> of the main database, which specifies the
   root of your primary MP3 collection. A minimal version of your configuration file
should thus contain </p>

<pre>
# minimal ~/.pytone/pytonerc defining the root of your music collection
[database.main]
musicbasedir=/root/of/your/music/collection
</pre>

<h2><a name="usage"></a>Usage</h2>

<p>After having adjusted the basic configuration variables to your
personal needs, just start the program with</p>

<pre>
$ ./pytone
</pre>

<p>and look how the database is being rebuilt. The key bindings
described below should say all about the use of PyTone. A list of command line options can be obtained by </p>

<pre>
$ ./pytone --help
</pre>

<p>Then let it rock...</p>

<h2><a name="history"></a>History</h2>

<p>PyTone was written since my favourite MP3 Jukebox (KJukebox) wasn't
maintained anymore. Its simple user interface and good usability even
without a mouse combined with the crossfading ability of the player,
have not been reached by any other free program. Especially for the
use at a party, KJukebox was very well suited.</p>

<p>However, after looking around on the net for sometime, I found <a
href="http://mjs.sourceforge.net/">mjs</a>, a curses based MP3 Jukebox system,
which featured a really simple and efficient GUI. Unfortunately, it was
written in C and already the first attempts to tailor it to my needs showed
that probably a Python version of this program would be a great win. That's
how the development of PyTone started...</p>

<p>After one week of intensive programming version 1.0 of what was then called pyjuke
was ready and was deployed during a three day long party. It proved to be very
usable (even on a 38400 baud serial terminal) and astoundingly stable, even
under extreme, Woodstock like conditions (very heavy rain + deep mud <tt>:-)</tt> )</p>

<p>Subsequently, the internal mad based player was written, which provides
crossfading capabilities without using xmms, a new, more imaginative name was found
(kudos to Harry!) and PyTone was released. </p>
